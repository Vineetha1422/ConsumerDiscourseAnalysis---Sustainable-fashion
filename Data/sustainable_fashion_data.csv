The most sustainable fashion,"right? people on here are arguing about what companies are actually sustainable or what brands are the best option…BUYING NEW IS NEVER THE BEST OPTION!!! theres an abundance of clothing on this planet, take a look at those before even considering buying new “sustainable” clothing",102,1646938898.0,2001questions,9

The most sustainable fashion,"I agree!!  As a fashion industry professional, almost all ""sustainable"" products are fraudulent.  Recycled fibers have a huge emissions impact, more than virgin fibers.  Almost all organic cotton is not really organic, and there isn't a clear environmental benefit from organic cotton anyhow.  Bamboo is one of the most harmful fibers out there because it has to go through a chemical bath to make it into rayon.  The fashion industry inherently is not sustainable because more waste is created, and huge amounts of water, energy and chemicals are used.  Not to mention the GHG emissions from shipping goods all over the world. 

The ONLY solution is to buy less and repair/reuse.",51,1646926717.0,Silver_Rice_8218,7
The most sustainable fashion,I believe the problem is also that the clothes being produced now is such a low quality that it is difficult to get much wear out of it.

The most sustainable fashion,"The most problematic part of this post is that it seems completely unaware that clothes are made by people. Millions of people. 95% of which don't earn living wages. 

Any definition of sustainable fashion that doesn't acknowledge people isn't complete. Brands making new clothes that pay living wages and reduce their environmental impact are an important part of the solution. Brands like Outland Denim and Nisolo. Supporting these brands over fast fashion is a great thing. It creates great jobs while also being more sustainable.

There is no contradiction in supporting buying less, repairing, upcycling, buying from sustainable brands, thrifting, AND swapping. They are ALL part of the solution.

Only focusing on the solutions with the strictly speaking lowest environmental footprint is a bit inhumane. Especially if you understand the history of fashion. That's like saying we know garment workers have been abused for decades so now let's just forget about them completely and let's not acknowledge the solutions that are considering them. 

It's also pretty unrealistic to assume people are going to stop buying new. If we can accept that obvious truth, then solutions that help people support the best brands when buying new are also important.

Again - I applaud what's good about this post - calling out the need to focus more on buy less and repair - but putting down other solutions and failing to acknowledge their merit isn't how you shine a light on the solutions you care about.",11,1653593602.0,EcoStylist,0
The most sustainable fashion,"You're 100% correct!!  The best thing you can do to be sustainable is make do with what you have, learn to repair and fix your own clothes, get creative, etc.  

There are some very interesting new companies like Borobabi, which rents infants clothes based on size.  Although there are also issues w/ the carbon footprint of renting clothes, I believe it's still better for the environment than buying something new that may be able to be used just once before it goes into a landfill.

I personally wear cloths their entire life span. (For example I wore my last jacket for over a decade and my skiing outfit is even older) So I can live with myself if I buy the few things that I need new.

Are there any Slow Fashion subs out there?",7,1650672817.0,JeepersMurphy,0
The most sustainable fashion,"So true, what you’ve stated and many have in the comments here is a movement called Slow Fashion. If you have to buy something, spend the money to buy something quality that will last you forever. Screw trends or seasonal colors, pick a style you like that makes you happy when you look in the mirror and stick to that. Don’t let influencers or peers tell you what to buy - that’s beta smol pp energy right there. The key is to be an educated consumer and not fall into the tricks even sustainable brands put out there. I work in fabric sourcing and best keys I can give are 
1. Educate yourself on what is and what isn’t greenwashing. Ask questions to yourself when looking at what a product is made of, in particular think about the processes ie: does it really make sense to turn bamboo into a fiber? The answer is a fat no. By the time bamboo is in a useable fiber form, the actual bamboo cells and such are untraceable. It’s mostly hash chemical based viscose, bamboo was just the input instead of wood pulp. 
2. Look at sewing/make on garments before buying if you’re in a store (or online, retuning is always an option). It’s honestly not that hard to spot cheap make and trims when you look for it up front. 
3. Country of origin; this one gets overlooked a lot bc some brands try real hard to hide that they’re having kids in Bangladesh make their clothes - but keep an eye out for this. Shop at better to best level brands that talk about their factory partners and where they make and source their stuff. The best brands don’t have secrets and ideally would like to spend their beliefs/sourcing strategy so the industry as a whole can improve its act. Patagonia is a great example, on almost all of their products they list both fabric mill and factory - and are openly transparent about their environmental philosophy (if you haven’t already read it pick up a copy of Let My People Go Surfing - will change your mind/viewpoint forever. Not my fault if it makes you want to quit your job and work there lol).",10,1646971381.0,mblair017,3
The most sustainable fashion,"While you've hit on a really important point, I wish it wasn't framed in such a divisive way.

Sustainable fashion is all about making better choices, be that using what you have, repairing it, thrifting, swapping, DIY, upcycling, repairing, or supporting more sustainable brands. These are all important parts of the solution and it's all about better choices, not perfect choices.

We shouldn't pit solutions against each other, we should see the good and value of each approach.

Supporting a brand that pays living wages and reduces its environmental footprint is a good thing. 

Does every solution need to include buying less and changing our relationship with consumerism? Yes. 

But we also need to recognize the complexity of individual circumstances. Everyone will never flock to one solution (be that thrifting or buying new) so a multitude of approaches is essential. And we should be able to recommend different approaches (there is no contradiction). 

I totally agree that all the approaches you mentioned need more attention, and deserve it, but  attacking other genuine approaches isn't how you get there.",11,1652208940.0,EcoStylist,1

The most sustainable fashion,"It's an interesting discussion. Not everything can be bought second hand or fixed. I would argue shoes can fall into that category a fair amount. There is a want to hook into truly sustainable fashion markets but there is a high price attached and to be frank the wealthy aren't the ones who contribute the most to the fashion cycle.

I used to work in fashion and trends are set by consumers and are largely repeated. The stands outs to me have always been about fabrics and cuts but this is a whole other tangent. 

There is B Corp companies. This is something easily looked up. This is a continuously updated movement that validates a company based on the whole cycle. For example like many have been saying if fast fashion companies ceased to exist then the economic fall out would be huge for the workers. So with this in mind B corp forces companies to evolve in a way where this wouldn't be an immediate catastrophe. I am of course paraphrasing an entire organisation but you can find more here [https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us)

One of the companies that I think is doing really well at this is TOMS footwear. They are consistently updating their practice to do better and their products aren't super expensive. Perhaps just not everyones taste.

So there are methods out there to try and better the situation by looking at all the possible solutions and not just simply stop buying. Of course every item uses resources but they always will. I don't think we can simply just stop buying and only look to second hand as the quality isn't there. It needs to be top down but it also needs to be in our choices of product whilst avoiding the need to buy new (actually old) trends. 

Also huge high fives for Patagonia. Also isn't there a company who are making yarn out of orange peel excess from Italy? Could we say that not one resource i.e Mycelium, bamboo, hemp etc... is going to be sustainable if it is overused. 

We can't vilify those who cannot afford either in time or money to buy sustainably. It is too much to ask. Really we need to empower areas that are doing the work in the hope that they prevail.",3,1664209215.0,BothSecretary8200,0

The most sustainable fashion,"Yes! Agree with this post so much.. exceeept thrifting/second hand - there's so much issues with that too and unless you're directly exchanging clothes with your friends you're still part of it.

*it is a very rare case that your donated garment will end up in a nearby charity/thrift shop - most garments still go on an essentially secondary global supply chain to get reused

At the end of a day reduce and reuse ( I personally like ""live the clothes you have"") is the only answer, and when you absolutely must buy something - invest in high quality so you are able to have that piece for decades to come - that's why I think there should be a place in this subredit for new clothes recommendations etc. (tho yeah, sometimes it seems its the only focus and that def is not great, to say the least)",2,1646994275.0,PaulBernB,1

All lie and that is the fact. I can not believe how many people trust and buy from these kinds of brands. Firstly it is not just the fabric in mind it is also the shipment air travel is such huge pollution and no one says anything about it. But on the other hand it is not that easy or simple to just start being sustainable, it takes time and to be honest almost impossible at a time like this, we should go to the new age to be sustainable. And this not just for fashion truly, it is everything do you really think that tesla for example is a sustainable car for the enviroment? NO  it is not do you know how much polluting it is created just to create the battery for the car, it is toxic. So from now on it is best not to believe most of the stuff that is marketed, cus it is simply not true it is called Marketing Trick to lure more buyers and make more profit. We should also start from India workers work for what 10-50 cents and hour in such terrible places toxic and bad for mental and physical health. That is not sustainable.

The most sustainable fashion,"My understanding is yes. Let's say a polyester shirt has 200 wear days. If you wear shirts once a week for 50 weeks out of the year, the shirt still has 150 wear days remaining. 

If you throw it away, it will sit in a landfill very slowly breaking down into microplastics that enter the soil, water, plants, etc. Here in Colorado, we found microplastics in our rain! 

Then you buy a new polyester shirt to replace it. Wear for 50 days and toss it. Repeat annually. At the end of 4 years there are now 4 shirts slowly degrading in landfills. It's also more industrial runoff, more unethical labor, more water, etc.

If you keep the shirt and wear it for 4 years, at the end of 4 years there is one shirt in a landfill. The overall impact of your shirts is a 1/4 because you actually wore it for its entire life. Better yet, find a way to upcycle it so you can get more use out of it. 

Maybe your weight changed, maybe you hate that shirt, or whatever, so you want to get it out of your wardrobe. Donating it helps someone else keep clothes on themselves and keeps it from going to a landfill. Someone else picks it up and can wear it for the remaining 150 days. Either way, your clothes will eventually end up in a landfill, so wear them as much as possible first. You may be ready to start wearing eco-friendly, ethical clothes, but the most sustainable option is to wear what you have now.

Buying thrift is also a good option because you are spending less and lengthening clothing's actual life. Once produced, the damage is pretty much done, so buying thrifted synthetic is fine.

However, this added step in the yarn production  process pales in comparison to the emissions generated from virgin fiber production (e.g., the emissions generated from cotton, wool, or polyester production…not to mention land use, water scarcity, eutrophication, chemical usage, biodiversity loss, etc).

The most sustainable fashion,"I would need to read an LCA comparing the GHG, water and energy use to compare; thus far I have not read any academic paper comparing the different systems.  If you know of one, please DM me. 

Recycling has many impacts during manufacturing that need to be taken into consideration during an LCA. For example, mechanically recycled polyester comes out different colors (beige/yellow/ grey)so it needs to go through extra chlorine bleaching processes before dyeing. It also affects dye uptake and may have to go through several dye procedures. Recycling wool or cotton shortens the staple length significantly and causes the fabric to break down quicker, shortening the garment life. All this needs to be taken into consideration when developing an LCA. 

I also wonder when considering plant-based fibers like cotton, flax or hemp, does the carbon being sequestered in the plants offset the GHG emissions from recycling? There are many unknowns that I have not seen answered yet. 

My biggest concerns with recycled polyester are the fact that the manufacturers are claiming it is recycled when it is not (similar to what is happening with organic cotton), because it is so easy to defraud consumers.  And then there is the issue of plastic bottles being made specifically for the purpose of being recycled, as one US manufacturer has been caught doing.

Polyester is out of control,"The main reason it's made is just simply because it's cheaper than natural materials and that's what consumers want+higher profit margin for brands. It's the same thing for even upper level brands selling polyester and PU clothing. Except now it's marketing 'vegan leather'. And 'easy to wash'. I just see this mindset affecting traditionally made items like kimono usually made from silk. Even in active wear, the moisture wicking properties also don't tell you that it's a ripe breeding ground for bacteria and cause more smell than if you just wore a knit cotton T-shirt.


I'm just so done with companies trying to market plastic as some beneficial fiber. When we /have/ fibers and woven styles are are just as suitable and if not more suitable. 
For example silk can be woven like mesh for summer, (in Japanese) you can look at 羅、絽、or 紗 weaves to see examples of summer silk weights. Natural fibers can be woven or knit. 


Fine Linen processes have been lost compared to other cheaper processes leading to smaller fiber size.

You can also go to big thrifting events where a bunch of vendors from depop or small business owners come and sell their goods in booths (i.e. world’s worst in sacramento and san jose— definitely check out your local depop vendors to see if they’re doing events in your area). I’ve struck a lot of gold shopping this way, esp since they curate their pieces so it makes the experience easier. You also get to build your second hand shopping community, meeting the vendors that have your style down. A lot of these vendors do personal shopping too, so if you need more eyes to help you find what fits you they’re there to help. It’ll definitely be more expensive but for those one of a kind, great quality, pass-down-able, even grail pieces, I’d definitely invest in your local secondhand shopping community.

Ask them to participate in a clothing swap, and bring in some customization tools (fabric paint, bedazzler, scissors, etc) to make it your own. Make it a little party!

I agree with you to a certain degree that it's not the most sustainable practice to produce new textiles.

No such thing as sustainable brands,"I'm not convinced by how ""sustainable"" ""ethical"" some of these brands actually are. Seems it's just a buzzword now  to convince people that paying a premium for the branding means they've bought their way out of the problem. But unless the product is like Fair Trade Certified and Rainforest Alliance and all that stuff, it isn't actually ""ethically"" produced the way it's implying.

 I see people online saying that thrifted clothes are low quality and I'm like, what world are they living in? Even cheap clothes from 10-20+ years ago are good quality compared to modern 2020s fast fashion. I have vintage cotton t-shirts from the 90s/2000s that I've been wearing for 4+ years now, abusing in the dryer cycle, and they're still going strong. That's a quality and more ethical purchase for a normal price, like ~$20 on ebay, or way cheaper if you get lucky at the thrift stores/estate sales.

No such thing as sustainable brands,"I think it’s a couple of things. People donate to the thrift stores closest to them, so you have that to consider. There’s also the problem of firsthand plus sized fashion being crap - a lot of more well-made brands don’t run larger than XL, so the brands that are exclusively plus sized are often producing fast fashion that’s not really either well made and sustainable or legitimately on-trend and desirable (take a look at the what’s new section on Torrid’s website) and is not priced at a level that reflects quality. All of those things make the clothing less likely to still be of wearable quality and desirable to a buyer when the first owner is done with them.",3,1721228533.0,allegedlydm,0
No such thing as sustainable brands,"I think in general, people who are plus size have fewer clothing choices and therefore don’t shop to the same extent that non-plus sized people do. Plus size clothing also tends to be more expensive. And a third reason, which is also why you don’t find many plus size historical garments, is because plus size clothing can usually be altered to fit someone else or to a smaller size if it’s of good quality. A garment that is too small usually cannot be made bigger in a meaningful way.",3,1721233830.0,thatsusangirl,0

They’ll put out a handful of plus size pants at a time but we were expected to put out a certain number of each size and plus size has the lowest expectation. They say it won’t sell.

Toad and Co is a more affordable option - they are all about sustainability but I’m not certain of how they treat their garment workers (if anyone knows please feel feel to comment!). I really like their Taj jumpsuit but some of their clothes are a little more outdoorsy than I am.

Non-ugly sustainable fashion?,"The best sustainable clothes I’ve been able to find have been through Etsy. It takes a bit of digging at first, but now I have sites I religiously purchase from that I love. I try to find small companies I can support, (local as often as possible) and buy things like organic cotton garments or linen (which uses significantly less water to make vs. fast fashion garments).

Specifically linen, I feel can be used as fancy or going out clothes, depending the garment you choose. It lasts forever and looks expensive, and —especially on Etsy you can send the seamstress your exact height, waist, bust sizing and your garment will fit you perfectly. Another upside to sustainable fashion. 

Sustainable clothes obviously cost more, but in the long run are better all around. You also get to support someone’s dream of owning their own business many times while you help the environment by buying clothing you will wear for much longer.

If organic clothes/linen are too out of one’s price range, I mean, thrifting is also the next best bet. 🤷🏼‍♀️I’ve found a ton of awesome stuff over the years thrifting. It just takes patience to dig, but I also think that’s part of the fun.",5,1595897060.0,Magic_ratt,2

* We try to be zero waste by upcycling, recycling and reusing materials.

* Biodegradable packaging.

* What a really love being a huge nature/mountain nerd is that we plant a tree with every single garment purchased.

But it's hard to convince people that they should pay for an expensive option when a cheap option that is, to them, just as good is available. The biggest buyers of fast fashion are middle class people who buy large amounts of clothes. They could afford better if they wanted to.

I'm not sure I would say that most people who buy expensive clothes are doing it primarily for style. If you only care about style, cheap brands have plenty of options. My thinking is, people who buy expensive clothes are mainly doing it for quality and/or prestige. But if style is a big concern, I think that's something that more sustainable/ethical brands should take into account. A lot of these brands, including hers, focus a lot on basics.

And I do have kids and I almost never buy them new clothing. Buying all new clothes every year for your kids is totally crazy, especially because there's so much lightly worn kid stuff out there.

Sustainable fashion is an oxymoron,"
I do think this is unrealistic, yes. 

 I guess first - fashion isn’t just a utility. It is an art as well, and a form of self-expression. Fashion impacts your mood, your posture, your self-perception, and DEFINITELY how others perceive you. Sometimes people tend to boil this down to making fun of the (particularly women’s) urge to dress “on trend,” but that’s not mainly what I mean. How many of us have heard the phrase “dress for the job you want, not the one you have”? Or noticed how differently you get treated depending on what you’re wearing? 

Second -  a lot of that clothing is already discarded or won’t last long, unfortunately. I don’t buy from Temu, SHEIN, etc. even second-hand because the garment won’t last and because there’s been plenty of alerts about lead content etc. 

Even finding secondhand clothing is very difficult for me  (partially because I won’t buy the ultra fast fashion secondhand, mostly because of my size - I’m a U.S. straight size 16ish at the moment, but that’s plus size in Europe, where I live) - I went to about 15 secondhand stores this spring with a visiting friend and found almost nothing in my size and nothing I wanted to try on. Online there are things, but very difficult to find again. I bought a skirt secondhand online for my Eras Tour outfit and still ended up having to alter it to fit (thankfully it was an easy alteration as I don’t currently own a sewing machine). The measurements the seller gave weren’t accurate. 

Third - People also go through different things with their body that change things. My body has changed a lot due to long-term illness, and so a lot of my wardrobe turned over. People get pregnant, ill, injured, need adaptive clothes, etc. 

People also change jobs, locations, lifestyles, and therefore need different clothes. Or they put something on and realized they had sensory issues. 

In the end I think it’s good to acknowledge that we can and should reduce our consumption, shop secondhand first, be willing to tailor and repair, borrow and swap if we can - AND that people will still need to shop firsthand.",7,1722834426.0,ledger_man,2

No. I could have had everything altered to fit my body even if those articles of clothing no longer suited my life and had negative associations but I didn't.

Sustainable fashion is an oxymoron,"Problem is that modern clothes suck and its usually the cheaper ones that you find in charity shops. They're often worn in places, stained and can have defects. I got a €60 pair of trousers when I needed office clothes, they were pilled at the crotch after 3 wears and since sustainable became fashionable, vintage clothes cost more than new clothes from a shop. So if you don't have a lot of money, you're stuck buying uncomfortable granny clothes or tacky knock off clothes from charity shops only to risk them lasting a few months because they're used and poor quality or you can buy new clothes from fast fashion shops.

There's also the difference between spending habits. Buying say 10 items of clothing a year from fast fashion is very different to going out shopping every few weeks. There are certain clothes I will only buy new. 1. Bras 2. Underwear 3. Socks 4. Gym clothes. I also like to layer clothes and Penneys (Primark) have a lovely vest top that feels like it has no seams which is really nice on my sensitive skin so I have 3 of those so far too.

I would say I shop sustainably because I might buy new clothes 3 times a year and they're just the 1-3 plus those comfy vest tops and I frequently try charity shops too, they can just be very hit or miss.

I don’t really have much spare time to do second hand shopping in person so mostly use Vinted, but even then I often end up with things that don’t quite fit or aren’t right in some other way that I either have to resell or donate. It’s a huge hassle and costs me time / money to do and is so inefficient.

"Hey guys, I just started a new Sustainable fashion brand. This collection is made from 100% GRS Certified Recycled Polyester & GOTS Certified Organic Cotton. Would love to hear your thoughts!","Thank you so much for your feedback we actually really appreciate it!

There is definitely two debatable sides to the use of recycled polyester. Yes we definitely agree that there is a problem with microplastics but to your point something like a jacket would not be washed often as you think. 

I believe it's not completely rational to state recycled polyester as unsustainable. Many studies have shown that recycled polyester produces less emission in comparison to its virgin counterpart.  Recycled polyester also reduces our dependence on using highly polluting raw resources such as petroleum & focuses on resusing plastic which is abundant & requires attention to get rid of. Plastic waste still needs to be addressed and the best way to approach it at the current moment is by recycling as its not going to disappear on its own (it will but going to take a long time)

We have already started to get in contact with manufacturers regarding bio-based polyester made from corn or other natural resources. So as the technology continues to develop, we will adapt to better & more sustainable alternatives!",4,1605269897.0,drasilking,1

I do think that natural (plantbased!) fibers are better and I prefer small quantaties and repairing stuff instead of buying it new. From the view at what we want achive I totally agree with you. ✌ My comment was related more objectively to the consumers side. The current reality of nearly 8 billion people and their (some of them) consuming behavior is not sustainable which is why I thought recycling is better than not recycling. Of course that is not the end of sustainable progress. But natural clothes are only sustainable if they are produced in feasible and small scale which on the one hand is part of the responsibility of the labels. But on the other hand the textile industry as a whole will never be sustainable if the consumers behaviour won't change which is a current process that needs some time.

Used clothes as sustainable alternatives? ,"Second hand clothes is the most sustainable way, whether it be fashion or anything else (washing machines, electrical appliances...).
Think about this : to fullfil a need, there's no justification why an object needs to be new.

When it comes to clothing, we've got clothes to outfit everybody in the world 10 times over, and more every year. Even if something new is made with ""sustainable cotton"", it still had to be grown and processed, and that take a LOT (a lot) of resources. 

But when you buy something second-hand ? Nothing was produced. You're even saving something from going into landfill (because most clothes cannot be recycled, specifically mixed fabric just aren't recyclable).

If you're not used to second hand clothes on your body, wash them when you get them. It's no different from buying new in store after someone's tryed it on (I've work in retail : clothes don't get washed).

Obviously, no one is going to buy very damaged or stained garments, and in my experience the vast majority of clothes for sale are either unworn, worn once or worn but well kept. I have bought a few items at bargain price and managed to mend (sewing a button and washing out a makeup stain, didn't even need stain remover).

I do not have the budget to spend £100+ on any item of clothing.

Just thrift isn't a helpful response. Buying second hand when you're petite is next to impossible because there's nothing available. I am not interested in or willing to alter things.

It’s like you have a friend that knows nothing about veganism and sustainability but wants to try to have a more sustainable diet, and they’re buying non organic vegetables for a meal bc they can’t afford to always buy organic, but you tell them “buying organic in season is actually more sustainable.”

Sure it’s simply information but presenting it in that context will make them feel like it has to be “all or nothing”, that they should choose the option that is the best sustainably.

There are lots of options out there, so if you think they're refusing to offer options then you are mistaken. 

 As far as things being ""overpriced"" I disagree. Expensive and out of the price range of many people, yes. Overpriced, no. They are priced according to what it costs to create good quality clothing without enslaving people and polluting their water supplies. I agree it's not always affordable. It's not for me either, and I make concessions as I have to. My main concessions have been purchasing one or two pieces at a time, being willing to have less variety (but I really enjoy what i DO have), and choosing cotton hemp blends vs more sustainable fabrics like linen or full hemp.

I feel this is an issue with people's own psyche, not with me sharing info. For example, I bought a hemp/cotton blend shirt a few months ago, and when I see info about how cotton is not ideal, I don't feel ashamed of my choice, or imperfect, or pressured into doing anything differently. I'm just like ""ooh, I gotta look into that for next time"". In fact, the expense is part of the reason why I don't have any fully hemp clothes...along with just not finding any in my style or knowing if I would like the feel of the fabric. Because this is a sustainable fashion subreddit, people have to be able to express information about what is and isn't sustainable and the pros and cons of different fabrics without worrying about other's feelings (obviously a true personal attack is different than just sharing info). I can see if I was like ""ALL these pieces are crap, they aren't sustainable, if you're buying them you're a bad person, why did you even post this""...that would be reflecting the shaming/discouraging thing you are expressing. People have to learn to be able to ingest information without letting it throw them off their own personal track. It's all about just doing the best you can.

If you only perceive 'complaining' when I share information, that's something going on with your perception of my factual information. Why do we have a sustainable fashion subreddit if we aren't able to discuss the sustainability of certain fabrics? I think you are making a lot of assumptions about where I am coming from considering my comments have been solely informational.

"Sustainable fashion is expensive. But, sometimes you just want an eco-friendly t-shirt that costs less than $30, so here are a few brands that do just that.","They might make interesting clothes, but they're not petite and therefore no use to me. There's no point in me buying a pair of trousers designed for a woman of 5'6 when I'm 5'0. I need something designed for someone my height. Nowhere does this. The only *petite* clothes that I have seen from any sustainable brands are either way, way too expensive or ugly, beige things that I wouldn't wear if you paid me. 

I know my size and I know what styles work for me. However sustainable brands don't make anything in my size and style. I like colour, patterns and pretty dresses that cinch in at my waist and preferably are knee length. If I'm wearing trousers, they need to be high waisted and hit my ankles, without being too long and baggy. Culottes look weird on me. I prefer skinnier trousers.

I have made a thread on this sub asking for any brands that do sustainable petite clothing. I haven't had a response. I have had the same thing with underwired, unlined bras that come in my size (no non wired bras. They're useless and I don't like them), nowhere makes them that isn't custom and therefore extremely expensive.",0,1603322797.0,None,11

Size is definitely a very interesting criterion we haven't initially thought of, even though it may seem really obvious from someone else's standpoint.

How would you expect this filter to work? Would you expect all possible sizes to be available as filter options? Or would it be sufficient to group them into broader ""size"" categories, like 4-8, 10-14, 16-20?

It's just so frustrating when you see these cool looking brands that have a bunch of leaf emojis and things like ""\~ Love Your Planet!\~"" in their instagram bios and you're like OK but what're you really doing? So they use organic cotton, so what? What about organic cotton is more eco-friendly? What pesticides are being used on the cotton? What fertilizers? (Organic fertilizers/pesticides are actually often more harmful than non-organic ones since they have to be used in much higher quantities and contribute to run-off problems in water sources). Is the company tracing their supply chain? What are they doing to reduce waste water? How are they dying their fabrics, and are they using toxic dyes that are harmful to the environment? How are they reducing fabric wastage? Are they paying their laborers fair wages- not just the people *sewing* the clothes but also the people harvesting the crops, weaving and dying the fabric, etc.    
Or with brands like Everlane, they have *great* sustainability practices and labor practices for their jeans (\*except union busting cough cough\*) but their other clothes/shoes are made in *entirely* different factories with far more lenient standards. So you think you're buying from this great brand but inreality not all their goods are to the same quality. It's just nuts!

Yes I agree wish people knew more about the dye used in fabric and threads and it's finishing.

And people should know more about certification like gots and oeko tex.

Personally I look forward for plastic free lifestyle products whether furniture, housing, clothing that would be a massive change ngl.

If they really want genuine plastic free sustainable clothes.

You’ve likely heard someone say “sustainable fashion is expensive” but this is actually a myth. Here are 3 reasons + 13 brands that may change your mind...,"I’m new to sustainable fashion and I’m slowly but surely making changes and educating myself on where and what I’m consuming; but admittedly, I am a little curious as to how sustainability translates over to quality. In my research, no one quite seems to talk about the quality of cloths your getting when your shopping sustainably compared to fast fashion, and those you hear from generally don’t know as much as they think they do. 

Someone like Justine Leconte on YouTube goes into great detail as to what to look for when shopping for new cloths (fibers, fabrics, weaves and knits, texture, seams, shape, etc.) Quality can mean very different things to very different people. I believe that if we brought more attention to all of this, this would likely convince more people to take the road towards being a more mindful consumer.

This is a great question - generally there is a correlation between sustainable brands and quality however, to your point, it's not always the case as every brand has to work through their quality issues. 

I look for quality in the brands I curate and here's some examples:

* Adelante Shoe Co. makes all of their shoes to be resole-able. I've had a pair of their boots for 3 years now (lots of wears) and they are ready to be resoled so I can wear them for many more years (as far as I can tell - they still look great)
* Taylor Stitch offers a guarantee on their clothes which backs up the quality 
* Outerknown makes high quality stuff and offers a lifetime warranty on their jeans
* Nudie Jeans offers lifetime repairs on their jeans 
* ISTO makes really high quality tees and button-ups (and I own a couple)
* Tact & Stone makes really high quality men's clothes too
* Brands like Kamen Road and Parker Clay design their wallets, bags, etc. to last many many years

Maybe it's worth doing a post to highlight brands explicitly focused on quality. What do you think?",7,1582492333.0,EcoStylist,1

It is true that (especially the ""durability"" part) can be a challenge in some cases for brands with a clear sustainability focus. This is, in part, because some of the materials and finishings that are most durable have a higher environmental impact. 

I have also started to create some content around the subject of sustainable fashion and on the video where I talk about the [materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQdP76bZrc8) a go a bit into this.

A quick guide to sustainable fashion... If you have any more..,"Fantastic list! I’d add to your points - 

One - Recycled wool and cashmere is also on the market for vegans who don’t want to contribute to demand for virgin animal products! Look for GRS certifications. There’s also peace silk, a term for the more rustic silk derived from taking the pods after the silkworms exited naturally. So, still some options! If you’re a knitter or crocheter, all of Knitting for Olive’s silk yarns are this type of silk. 

Six - I’d really encourage people to track what they wear. I started 1/1/21 and have learned a lot - plus now I can keep track of how much I’m wearing each piece as well as my wardrobe overall. I also track how I acquire and get rid of things, and how much/how often. 

Nine - Also dryer sheets! Wool dryer balls are a great alternative, as is hang drying and not using your dryer as much (I do a combo of both). I also like using a few drops of essential oil on the dryer ball for things like towels & sheets! Gives them a nice but not overbearing scent.

4. I do not think this is highly dependent on where you live and how your clothes are constructed. I lived most of my life in a rural area with rusty water. It worked. I am also in Canada in a cold climate.

* Cold water is fine for most clothes and other items that you can safely put in the washing machine. It can remove many stains from clothing,
* Delicate fabrics (lace and silk) and dark, colorful fabrics actually do best in cold water.
* Not all stains respond to warmer water. For example, blood and sweat can actually set into fabric in hot water. Also, hot water tends to shrink, fade, and wrinkle certain fabrics.
* Cold-water washing means clothing is less likely to shrink or fade and ruin clothes.
* Cold water can also reduce wrinkles, which saves energy costs (and time) associated with ironing.

If you want to really sanitize your clothing, because you wore them when you were sick, and want to get rid of the germs, then by all means, wash in hot water.",3,1702246035.0,slovenlyhaven,2

If you can't find a used synthetic option, than buying a new article of clothing that has natural fibers is probably your best bet. But I would say buying a synthetic used is better than buying a natural new.

But it's best to shop your own closet first. It is estimated we only wear about 20% of our clothes, 80% of the time.

SO in order...

1. shop your own closet,
2. repair/tailor something that is old or no longer fits..
3. borrow from someone. (if you're only going to wear it once or twice.)
4. buy used clothing made from natural fiber fabric.

5 buy used clothes made from synthetic fibers

6. make your own clothes from natural fibers or old fabric you have laying around, or from old used synthetic clothes you decided to turn into something new.

6. buy new clothing, made from natural fibers.

7. buy new clothing from recycled material, that happens to be synthetic fiber fabric.

Do you believe that designing adjustable clothing that grows with the kids is a valuable solution to address the waste produced by children's clothing?,"Yep, this used to be really common. Even something as simple as a deep hem on pants would be great. Waistbands that can be adjusted by buttoning the elastic shorter are gold (do they not still do that? My kids aren’t that old). 

The problem is that you have to retrain consumers that the extra fabric and production costs are balanced out by having to buy new clothes less frequently (and also, this type of construction usually is sturdy enough to last through a round of hand me downs). People who can’t sew a hem or pick out a seam will take a pass, so all you can do is be creative with adjustable closures.

The Back-to-School industry has everyone convinced kids need a whole new wardrobe every year, and we’re only now coming out of the era where thrifting and hand me downs were ridiculed as uncool to fuel fast fashion.

Definitely a case of consumers acting against their own self-interest. I do think you can easily sell this to people who are *already* thinking about sustainability, or who go for the  craftsmanship was better in the olden days aesthetic. There’s probably a sweet spot in the 3 to 6 year old market, and boys pants specifically. If you have the wherewithal to educate your prospects you can probably convert some more customers.

There are some red flags tho. As the other comments say, they are a fast fashion brand producing for trends which typically do not last for more than a year. Their “smart model” may help them adjust production in real time, but how far out are they requesting these orders that they have no excess inventory? Also, only some items in the collections are made from recycled fabrics or partially recycled fabrics. There is no take back program discussed either. 

Be mindful of greenwashing with regards to its suppliers. They make claims of what is apart of their zero tolerance policy but only provide three examples for transparency. They could have 50-100 more suppliers that are not by these standards. Just take note of the potential cherry picking here. 

These are my thoughts by just doing a quick glance of the link you sent. I also don’t intend to completely bash them. I think this is great progress for fast fashion brands to have pages like this. However you need to be aware that waste and exploitation is rooted in the business model of fast fashion. 

If you do shop from here consider what the other commenters have said: choose timeless pieces and look for better quality materials in the product descriptions. Or stick to shopping the more sustainable options.",7,1681397666.0,L0t_s,1

I recently started a small business sustainable fashion brand Ozone Apparel that I have had great feedback on the logo and ethos - what are people's thoughts? would really appreciate! website: www.ozoneapparel.store,"Hey! Congrats on starting your business:) I do have some feedback.

\- I like your logo, for the most part. I think it's pretty polished and has an earthy outdoors-y feel. That said, I'm not sure it really has a strong ""brand aesthetic"", y'know? I'm not sure that the logo and the name really screams what you're about. I think in the future a slogan might help you, to mix up your T-shirts and designs a bit. 

\- You have a video on your website featuring a tee that has your logo screenprinted on the back, but I don't see it for sale, which doesn't make sense because that would be the first thing I wanted to buy. 

\- You *definitely* need to invest in better photography and editing for your modeling shots. This is not even close to professional quality and does not do your brand credit. I know it's hard when starting out but trust me- this kind of stuff matters. Your website says ""high quality pfoducts!"" but your pictures say ""we took these in our college dorm with a phone camera and a bed sheet."" They make your clothes look cheap and set the expectations low. Not good. 

\- You state that you're committed to ""sustainability"", that's awesome! But the wording on your ""Our Mission"" page is clunky and overly-wordy. Tighten that shit up, make it snappy and catchy but still informative. You only sell like, *two* T-shirts right now. The only reason anyone is going to buy them is because they care about sustainable products. You HAVE to sell them on the fact that you're *actually sustainable and ethical*and do it quickly*.* Nobody wants to read this much rambling.   


For example:   


"" We want to incite change in the clothing industry by basing all of our products and methods on sustainability, recycling, and general eco-friendliness. By buying our products, people can look good whilst doing good.

​Yet, to understand how supporting us can help give the planet a fighting chance at survival - you need to understand the situation we are in, the issues we face, and the ways we can solve it.""   


Remember that this might be *all people ever read.* Not everyone is going to keep reading past this. And frankly, this opening statement is a mess. It's too long, and it sounds kind of whiney. ""*We want to be sustainble but you have to understand the position we're in! It's hard!*"" is not the message you want to be sending. Try something more like:   


""We founded Ozone Apparel so that you can feel good while looking good. All our products are made with sustainability and the environment in mind. Find out more about how we're fighting fast fashion and helping planet earth while doings o...""   


I mean that's not perfect either (I don't write copy, it's hard!) but you need to have something better for *sure.*

The images should and will be improved - I promise! haha

Yes I agree - the copy needs decluttered and simplified, however there is a 'our sustainability' page which I think is quite clear and helpful however maybe I should make this more prominent or combine it with the 'our mission' page?

Recycled plastic clothing is still plastic and still ends up in our oceans.,"this sentiment is out there and it's certainly valid. I'd say its tricky. There's certain waterproof products where it's just gonna be really tough to make anything decent that not a poly or nylon and for those like you said, recycled is better than virgin. 

But you're definitely right that we don't need to be putting recycled plastic bottles in t-shirts. But again, even there it's tricky because there are benefits to using synthetics versus cottons as well (way less energy, way less water waste and way less pollution). Aka this stuff is tricky in a lot of regards.",14,1570421260.0,van_dalized,1
Recycled plastic clothing is still plastic and still ends up in our oceans.,"I think it is currently necessary but not the end goal.

We need to do something with our overwhelming amount of plastic.  With more companies processing it, there is more incentive to improve the processes and for it to become more affordable.

But it does need to be combined with things like guppy bags to collect the microfibers.  But the plastics are ending up in landfills and breaking apart regardless, so we should be prolonging its life while solutions are being created.  This reduces harm.

Furthermore, we will not see a society that makes the most susyainable choices unanimously.  At least not in our lifetime.  There will always be people who want brand new fabrics and clothes rather than reusing existing clothes, buying less, etc.  We unfortunately need to cater somewhat to this, we need better alternatives to what they currently have even if we know it isn't the best choice.",3,1570460096.0,None,0
Recycled plastic clothing is still plastic and still ends up in our oceans.,"As a clothing manufacturer focused on using eco-friendly fabrics I agree. Recycled poly is still plastic and although making it produces less CO2, it puts more micro-plastic into our water than virgin poly. We use reclaimed poly (fabric that's destined for the landfills) but it's still a micro-fiber that sheds into our water. The tough part is getting fabric mills to keep innovating at a faster pace, especially for activewear that relies on performance fabrics like polyester. We are working on a new development with our mill and hope to be synthetic/poly free by early 2020. If this fiber works, soon we'll be able to say goodbye to polyester.

Why do you still buy Reformation & Everlane?,"When you read about situations like these, it becomes very clear that their marketing strategy did exactly what they intended. By playing it off like they are SUPER transparent and giving us a look into their operations, they give someone who is a slacktavist the ability to feel better about themselves. We take everything so face value and this gives companies the ability to fool the vast majority. By practically giving us this information, you would think that these companies have nothing to hide. However, I knew from the very beginning that something was off. I always ended up asking the same question, why be so transparent? There is no incentive for this. Now that there is a niche for sustainable concepts, companies are seeing it as an opportunity to hop on a trend. You can't have your cake and eat it too; ethics and sustainability go hand in hand. It is also very apparent that neither of these companies surpass the fast fashion standard. Their client base is so vast that there is NO WAY to be 100% sustainable. I have read countless articles about how their ideas go from the drawing board to the stores in a month flat which seems pretty fast fashion to me. We can't criticize forever 21 and Zara for their unethical practices because they never really claimed to be in the first place.

Moral to the story, do your research. Companies build their market off of people who claim to be woke. Also know that CEO's and VP's really have no incentive to uphold their practices because they know there will still be a following no matter the circumstance.",2,1603329678.0,devils-advocate143,1

Sustinability in Fashion - Hot Takes Only,"“Wear anything, but wear it out.”

I know this will be controversial, but as so many others have mentioned here, sustainability issues are systemic, complex, and opaque. 

Simplicity is great, but “elevated peasant chic” gets tiresome after a while. So I think, if you see some high-design neon poly/nylon windbreaker and you love it, it’s ok to get it IF you wear it to death.(I know, I know… dyes, microplastics…) 

The point is, if we all consume like this and dress with creativity, we can individually express our diversity and unique style while we unconsciously, inadvertently, and collectively slow down consumption (without it feeling like austerity.) 

Drops in overall sales volume should prompt manufacturers to take notice; when we have their attention, we push for better behavior/ more regulation. 

As a consequence, we would reduce pollution and sweatshop labor. Our mental energy would be put toward expressing our style; changing our attitude about consumption shouldn’t have to be an act of self flagellation. Meanwhile, shame producers, not consumers.

This may sound like hypocrisy to some, and if you can dress according to your morals, go for it! But since these issues are systemic, think about how to change the system, because we’re all in it.",10,1720496344.0,emerald_garden,1

Sustinability in Fashion - Hot Takes Only,"There’s a lack of contextualisation in general  when it comes to sustainability in fashion and across retail. Not many consumers know what anything means. Buzz words are used liberally, with little preamble or deeper explanation. But brands use them because they fit in nicely with our diminishing attention spans, while still feeding our need for *just enough* understanding to make us feel like we are making an educated decision. 

Sometimes it seems like brands are playing a magic trick on us and it’s all just a big game of misdirection. To be clear, I’m not tarring all brands with the same brush here - I think there are many  who are genuinely trying to communicate better and some who accidentally greenwash because of a lack of guidance/changing regulation that they didn’t catch up on before the fact. But it’s the buzzwords used with key context omitted that annoys me. 

They’ll release a new “eco line”, with lots of “low impact fabric” but no one knows what “low impact” means because there’s no context. It just leaves us wondering: what is high impact then? Everything else? 

In fashion, the impact of a brand’s Purchased Goods and Services category within their total Scope 3 emissions output, is usually around 70-90%+. This includes, all raw materials, manufacturing processes, materials for packaging etc needed to produce and ship the clothing. The new eco line they just released is a teenie-tiny-apparently-good drop in the ocean. The rest is responsible for hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of tons of scary level CO2 equivalent impact. 

They give this data no air time. Why would they? It’s all hidden deep in the pages of some impact report on some obscure table that you need a masters degree to get your head around. But this is the important context we need to truly understand how seriously these companies take the environmental side of the ESG equation (I acknowledge that sustainability, as a whole, is a multifaceted issue and ESG elements should be considered in conjunction).

My point here is that buzzwords can create a fictitious sense of education, making us believe that these are the only things we should be looking out for in our search for “sustainable” brands.",4,1720517570.0,Vegetable_Excuse_971,0

Sustinability in Fashion - Hot Takes Only,"1) Too many sustainable companies were so focused on their sustainable fabrics and manufacturing that they forgot to make their business finances sustainable and were then forced to close.  

2) At least 50% of folks surveyed will say that sustainability is important.  Hence the reports that sustainability is important reports.  Perhaps 95% of them won't say that price, style, and fit are more important.  Or maybe they weren't asked.  Everyone's reading the summary of the survey and not asking how this survey was structured.  

3) Producing in the US is neither more ethical nor better quality.  Paying more for worse quality is a lousy business model.    Wages are higher but so is cost of living.  See #1.  

4) Circularity, secondhand, and thrifting are fringe.  Going from .01% to .02% is double what it was before but it isn't something that's going to move the needle.  

5) My hottest take is that the solution to the sustainability crisis isn't going to be government regulation, customer education, sustainability initiatives. It's going to be simply demographics.

I do wear second hand fast fashion just because I don’t look at the brands when shopping. Some clothing, mainly from the recent years, I don’t think could even be repurposed.

Would You Wear Revamped Fast Fashion? Seeking Opinions on Repurposing Fast Fashion Brands into Custom Clothing  ,"Upcycle specifically with fast-fashion fabrics? Absolutely not. 

One of the many problems with fast fashion is that the materials used are cheap quality: they're made poorly and aren't intended to last. I treat my clothes very well and after a session or two they get pilly, get holes, change shape, tear, etc. It's not just poor consign, it's the actual fabric. 

It's a waste of time to put the effort into making a garment by hand that will still fall apart or look like crap within, at best, a year. 

I know people here love to say upcycle and thrifting is the best thing to do, but I disagree. That will never create systemic change. Buy deadstock fabric or fabric that is sustainably and ethically produced and make or buy clothes from that. 

You spend more per piece, but you won't have to replace those pieces for a very, very long time. 

Show the industry this is a profitable model and things will change.",2,1723494249.0,Substantial-Image941,0

"Rain Sisters, worth the money, or am I falling for a social media advertising scam?","I felt the same. I happened upon a woman shopping in Lidl (of all places) wearing a Rain Sisters coat - I asked her if it was indeed one and how it was. She was very happy, especially the waterproofness - it isn't 100% according to the descriptions so I was hesitant. She told me (we live in rainy Utrecht NL and cycle everywhere) she'd never had the rain coming through in all the rain and biking over the past winter.

This was enough for me to take the plunge last spring when I just caught a discount. It was still a bit eye watering - I've never spent that much on a coat before and I'm 53! I absolutely love it. I get compliments daily and it looks stunning as well as being waterproof*enough* for commuting by bike and really practical.

"Rain Sisters, worth the money, or am I falling for a social media advertising scam?","Not sure if you’re still thinking about buying one, but I’m 5’0” with a 27” waist and 34” bust, and I got a petite XS in the green and black floral pattern. I’m thinking about returning it for an XS (and getting it hemmed) because the waist seam is higher than my natural waist, which makes it feel uncomfortably snug. Otherwise it’s great, it hits just below the knee and the sleeves are just slightly long (but I have short arms for my height). Unfortunately, I feel a bit like a little cupcake in it because it flares out so dramatically so high up. I could size up to a petite S, but I’m afraid that would add to the cupcake effect. I have an average torso length relative to my height, but I do have a bit of rib flare, so if you have a short torso, a high natural waist, or a narrow rib cage relative to your waist and bust measurements, the petite would probably work for you, otherwise I’d go with the normal length and get it hemmed, or go up a size in the petite. Also, I’d treat their size guide measurements as the upper limit for that size, eg I’m much closer to the XS measurements than the S measurements, but the XS it’s *quite* snug.",1,1733494751.0,Aware-Goose896,0

It's one thing when your newness comes once a year - it's another altogether when it's happening all day every day, all year long.

What got you to care about sustainable fashion?,"I'd always kind of cared... we do live in the anthropocene, after all, and I've been keenly aware of my personal impact on the planet since I was a kid--but there were two major factors that had the biggest impact on how much I cared about sustainable fashion.

The first was financial freedom. Throughout college and grad school, I wore whatever was cheap and easy to get my hands on. Sometimes that was sustainable by accident (e.g. secondhand clothes) but a lot of times, I just bought whatever I could afford, which was usually polyester and made in a distant sweatshop. But now, with a few years of a steady job under my belt, I have the money to spend a bit more on clothes... so I can afford the tencels and linens and wools that will last. I also have the luxury of weekends off, when I can go thrifting, rather than just buying stuff online. I have personal experience with the Vimes Boots Theory of economics... it does hold true.

The second was a growing desire to find my own personal style. If you always buy the same kind of clothes from the same few brands, you're much less likely to stop and ask, ""what are the alternatives?"" As the clothes I bought in college slowly wore out and needed replacing, I decided to start being more conscious about how and why I dress the way I do. For me, that also opened the door to dressing more sustainably... because suddenly, I was learning a lot about what textiles I preferred, and being much more conscious of what I was buying... really asking myself, ""do I even *like* these clothes? Will I wear them until they fall apart? Is this a wise decision?""",3,1708725004.0,FancyRatFridays,2

What got you to care about sustainable fashion?,"I accidentally and reluctantly started a [brand](https://www.blooh.co) in 2020 that works with artisans in Kenya to curb the fast fashion problem but more specifically to create sustainable employment for the countless talented people that have the talent to make stuff but can't seem to get market access. Reluctantly because I'm not sure that creating a fashion brand is the best way to solve this problem so I've been focusing on writing and educating our community more. I'd like to believe that with every tiny tinyyy choice I influence, maybe it creates a ripple effect on where people's next dollar goes.

After traveling and working throughout Africa for 7 or so years I was seeing the complexities of the global supply chain over an over (like how all the stuff that gets recycled here ends up in piles and piles in some developing country and cuts out the local economy). I loved seeing the vibrant markets and talent that was just stuck and eager to produce for a larger audience. So creating something was a serious eduction and introduction to sustainable fashion in a more tangible/serious way.

I love that this work has made me so much more aware about my own choices. I still struggle to be 100% sustainable but I'm happy I've found my middle path because over the years I've trained myself to be more mindful before most purchases and use that as an opportunity to really invest in quality items and learn/discover new makers and brands.

What got you to care about sustainable fashion?,"It is so great to see people caring about the sustainability in Fashion.

Someone mentioned about the chilean desert where the land is filled with fashion dump. In all honesty, my 11 year old son told me about that when he learnt about it in his school. My trigger point was the landfills outside Indian Capital New Delhi. Just outside the city, there is a mountain of filth. Surprise surprise, there are 2 on both sides of the national capital region. With that in mind, I quit my high flying career in IT and started a new brand based in Bangalore, India. Our brand ethos is ""No Blends, No Compromises"". This essentially means we will not, like many other famous brands in India, sell clothes that have viscose and polyester mixed with cotton and silk respectively. The idea was to be pure and share the dream with my customers. Since we are only 3 months old into the ecosystem, we are still struggling to find first customers. That being said, I am open to talk to fellow sustainability crusaders and see how we can partner together and take this message to the wider audience. This is of utmost importance today. The fabrics we are using are capable of being heirlooms for generations to come. So even when these are new, these clothes will not be found in landfills ever since their sheen remains forever.

Do you think second hand fashion is the most sustainable option for buying clothes?,"yeah I think in the medium/short term, you can realistically thrift as much as you want. I know I volunteered at a charity shop last year. I never even realised how bad it was. We used to throw away probably 200+ of clothing items every week because we didn’t have the space for them, and neither did any other stores in our area. January was awful, because everyone gets new clothes for Christmas. I think we must’ve thrown away over 1000 items in the first 2 weeks after Christmas. We would get bags and bags of donations every day, and sure people are buying more and more these days but it isn’t enough to match the donations. 

So yeah for the time being, I think people can thrift to their hearts content, at least the clothes are getting a little more use. But if we continue to see a rise in thrifting, and a decrease in fast fashion. Then purchases will increase and donations will decrease, and we’d have to be more careful.",2,1649600178.0,stressyanddepressy03,0

Religious Swastis are real and the direction it’s going isn’t the same as the Nazi swastika.  That having been said, it’s way too soon for these to be appearing in the US.

SHEIN has always seemed...  like nobody at the company actually lives on this continent though.  My first thought when I saw this was that it was a swasti and not a swastika based on the context of the company alone.  I feel like it was an honest mistake, but I also feel that Jewish people have the right to be upset at this, and that I can’t really relate enough.

What would you say is the biggest obstacle to sustainable fashion shopping?,"I don't buy from ""thrift"" shops for several reasons: they don't have my size (plus); the clothes smell weird; most of the stock was originally bought at places like Forever21 and Wal-Mart; re-sellers go there every day to snap up anything they think will sell at a yard sale; items are marked way up and either put on the website for sale or shipped to another city where buyers think they're getting a great deal (they're not).

I became more conscious of sustainable fashion about three years ago. I'd been buying all my clothes online after bad experiences with clothes I bought from department stores.  They didn't last more than a few months.  I began looking at videos on YouTube about fashion styling (not influencers), and learned what fast fashion is doing to us and to the planet.  I spent hours researching sustainable brands and which ones reflected my taste.  I learned that just because something is expensive, doesn't mean it's great quality.  Many sustainable brands are way out of my budget, but others are just fine.  I subscribed to StitchFix, and that's been a huge help.  I've discovered brands that I'd never heard of and could spend within my parameters, such as Democracy jeans, Threads 4 Thought, Liverpool LA, and LoupOnline.

What would you say is the biggest obstacle to sustainable fashion shopping?,"I’d say heathy competition and reach. 


sustainable brands often operate in a niche space with higher prices. This makes eco-friendly options less accessible to the average consumer. 


Additionally, sustainable fashion is inherently slow from the production and manufacturing level itself. For example- I make shirts and source the fabrics directly from the weavers and half of these fabrics are handloom fabrics. There is physical labour involved all the way which in-turn increases the cost of the final product (and time). Although, i’ve seen multiple brands who have 100x their pricing in the name of ‘sustainable’ but there are a lot of brands who are doing really good work.


PS- These are my own views and opinions that i have formed through my experience as a small business owner. So please spare me lol",2,1731986561.0,faxwithmebb,1

For new items, I’m lucky that cost isn’t a *huge* barrier to me, but it can still be challenging to find and research good sustainable brands. Also, most sustainable brands I’m interested in don’t have in person stores near me (or at all). It means my only option is ordering online and guessing at my size. That means i need to return a lot, which is just a waste of time and energy.

I buy most things second hand, but it is a HUNT. And it’s a lot of time and energy to invest to find options in your size, at your price point, and that you like. I joke that it’s my second full time job. I think thrifting most of your clothes is unrealistic unless you 1) really enjoy it as a hobby or 2) you are not remotely picky about your wardrobe.",2,1732017247.0,rekreid,0

What would you say is the biggest obstacle to sustainable fashion shopping?,"Price and access to what you need. Secondhand can reduce price but it doesn't mean you'll have access to what you need where you live.

However, they opened a wonderful secondhand concept where I live last year and I'm buying most of my stuff there now. Before that, buying sustainable was more of a passion project where I saved up for months for one wardrobe staple. Now it's actually doable with secondhand resources available. ",1,1732044373.0,cedence,0
What would you say is the biggest obstacle to sustainable fashion shopping?,"Definitely agree with it being time consuming. That goes for both secondhand and new. As for new, I'd say the styles and prices make it hard. For example, I wanted to get new underwear because mine is now too big for me because I've been losing weight. I've been trying to find underwear that's sustainable, but isn't going to cost me an arm and a leg to buy a week's set of. Even using discount codes from YouTubers I watch hasn't brought down the price enough. So, I guess I'll just deal with the bigger underwear. I've been thinking about buying like two or three pairs of cheaper underwear to get me through while buying a pair or two of sustainable underwear every few weeks. I understand that prices need to be high to promote sustainability and ethics, but at the same time, there needs to be something to help people afford it. I think this is less on the ethical and sustainable companies and more on other companies not paying people enough.",1,1732076112.0,AmarissaBhaneboar,0

Banana Republic seems better than most, has my styles, but also is a more premium brand, including a premium price tag.

I think sites like Good on You commit a great amount of time to ensuring that brands are sustainable. I'd say they're the gold standard in that department which is great because I'm based in the US and I know there are a lot more regulatory agencies and watchdogs for sustainable fashion in Europe than there are in the US if any. I think the focus on ethical and sustainable fashion in Europe is a lot greater than in the US and that's partly due to people simply not knowing that a lot of these brands exist.,2,1731969426.0,herlock03,0

Don't worry it's anonymous. Thanks! Happy holidays ❤","I enjoyed the survey and I love what you’re trying to do. But you have a few issues with how you’ve done it. 

For one: you placed a US centric survey on an international forum. Reading the comments,you said you didn’t expect many responses, which is fair, but instead of listing the states of America over 4 or 5 questions like you did I think it would be more beneficial in future surveys to simply have a text box answer where the respondents can fill in the country and state/province/territory. For example I live in Australia. Specifically Newcastle in New South Wales. This city is the biggest coal export in Australia and in the last few years there have been some issues with pollution in our waterways from the mining. Being able to have people list their specific location if they choose can help you also research the environmental impact of those places. On top of that you could add a question asking along the lines if the respondent is aware of any environmental issues in the area. With research from your end, you’ll be able to see general levels of education on a global level. 

Second: I make an effort to not buy clothes anymore. I’m an armature seamstress and have made the choice to sew any clothes I need from now on from thrifted materials. For you question regarding what a person would do with free money I would have answered ‘buy quality fabric to make a lasting garment’. My point here is not to include such a thing as an option but to instead be aware there are more options to environmental sustainability than thrifting. 

Third, which may be a browser thing on my part, but there was a question I couldn’t answer. It was a cost specific question and I assume it was displayed as a drop down box. Such a box never appeared for me. 

And finally, I believe your ethnicity section requires work. It is again very US centric for a survey sent out globally. I personally am Mediterranean by ancestry yet I didn’t see an option for that in your ethnicity section. I think either specify it based on skin (Caucasian, black, etc) or specify it based on region (Europe, Africa, etc). Not both like it appears you tried to do. 

I’m sorry this was so long but proper research is important for as accurate results as you can get. I hope you take these critiques on board. All in all it was relatively well done save for those few specifics. I hope I’ll get the opportunity to see the results too.",2,1606429191.0,0empty-Void0,1

The flow is really good--paragraph length is perfect for drawing the reader on, IMO. Personally, I would draw out the parallels/oppositions a little more (i.e. fast fashion uses a shotgun approach of producing a ton of products to see what sells; does slow fashion avoid this by knowing their customers' taste better, or by dictating taste through less selection, etc.) but that's more a question of style. Yours is more conversational, my preference is more a slightly more formal/long-form tone even in blog posts.

Also FYI: the text by the graphic for slow fashion has ""Trenblog"" instead of Trendblog; there's a mix of straight quotes and typographers quotes; and I'd hyphenate arch-rival or make it a single word--on my screen there was a line break right there which was confusing.

"Should organic cotton be considered ""sustainable""?","Great thoughts - this is an interesting point of discussion.

Organic cotton is definitely not the ""be all end all"" fabric - we will move away from it and towards alternatives like hemp and tencel. 

BUT I think it's important to consider 2 points:

1. **How much better Organic Cotton is vs. conventional cotton**. Conventional cotton is the most pesticide intensive crop on the planet and its often children, who are valued for their small hands, that are picking it. Organic cotton gets us away from that. It also moves us towards more sustainable farming practices.
2. **Where we are today**. We are not even close to being able to replace organic cotton with another fabric - the scale doesn't exist. Because of decades of strict regulation, the US is years behind on growing and processing hemp, so there is a catch up game being played right now. The only sustainable fabric that you might be able to scale to replace organic cotton would be recycled polyester which is good in many ways but has its own challenges (microplastics). It's also worth considering that organic cotton today makes up a very tiny fraction of cotton overall (maybe 1% - there is no good updated data that I've seen on this number)

For these reasons I would argue that at this moment in time, yes, organic cotton is a sustainable fabric and a good option worth considering.",13,1581096140.0,EcoStylist,5

TL;DR:  Is a fine read if you don't know anything else but should certainly only be used as a beginning point and not as a holy reference

Candidly, it's simply marketing content to capture an email and at best is a beginner's guide to sustainability and materials. It's a fun read but this should not be considered as anything but a ""qualitative"" study that gives some brief insight into the impact of those materials.

A proper scientific analysis ([like this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016816300102)) goes in-depth and references other sources that are also scientifically backed. If you take a look at the references of Green Story's guide, the majority of those articles referenced don't even indicate where their data came from in the first place, so why should we believe any of it?

Youtube channel sharing my journey to start a sustainable fashion brand?,"Couple of thoughts:

1. Content exists, but channels are often small.  Levi Hildebrand is probably the largest lately, but is more focused on sustainable lifestyle (more generally).
2. Sustainably focused entrepreneurs are another angle, and there are groups like Ashoka and UnLtd that have shared a lot of content.

Separate from that, I have been building my own channel where I document my own journey as well as interview other mission driven entrepreneurs.   The channel is small, but I have engaged with a wide range of entrepreneurs and brands who are looking to learn more (about my work or the work of those I have interviewed).

Here are links to a couple that are focused on sustainable fashion[Sustainable Fashion and Startups | Christine Goulay, Kering Group -](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-71WimiEiY)[Closed Loop Fashion and Sustainable Textiles in Hong Kong | The Mills Fabrica, Edwin Keh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djbMa7PKmTc)[Recycling Plastic Waste into Textiles | Monique Maisson, Waste2Wear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxdXRzZwnc0)[Tackling Textile Waste | Christina Dean, Redress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNjMgqzdLDQ)

For me, the development of the channel has been a very enjoyable process, and likes/ subscriber numbers aside, the value of interactions and knowing that I am inspiring/ helping others through the process of moving from inspiration to action is enough for me to keep moving forward.

So, wish you all the best, and if there is something I can help you answer or a resource I can point you to, feel free to reach out.

Never seen a company like this before. Interesting take on how to make sustainable fashion more accessible,"Good question. I don’t really know too much about plato’s closet and Buffalo Exchange.


As you’ve said, the biggest difference that stood out to me was that they’ll accept everything and sort the low quality stuff out themselves rather than telling you it’s not accepted.


Perusing their online store I also just got a feeling that I had access to a better selection which I think is due to them having their storage centralized. Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve often gone into second hand clothing stores and felt like they’ve already been “picked over”. I don’t know if it’s because people are buying items to try to sell or what, but I consistently felt like I had to work so much harder in order to find decent quality stuff.


Or it might be that the point system incentivizing swapping in order to keep the inventory fresh rather than just buying more more more like you can in other shops.


I’m also not sure how the pricing compares to secondhand shops but it looked less expensive at first glance. Like I said though, I’m not an expert on second hand shops so this may not be correct.",1,1597242867.0,Kelcak,1

But I think I'll stick to buying exactly what I want secondhand on Poshmark/ebay. Usually sellers there remember the names of the clothes so I can search for exactly what I want and only get that.

[[HELP A BROTHER OUT]] How do I verify legit sustainable & ethical brands?,"This is a great project! One thing that is perhaps unfair, but definitely influences my decision, is that I won’t buy sustainable products that are sold on Amazon.

[[HELP A BROTHER OUT]] How do I verify legit sustainable & ethical brands?,"Nice!

 well I'll chip in where I feel I can add the most info..

Strong Indicators that a brand is truly sustainable:

\-uses as few non-natural products/fabrics as possible (this is a wide area but I personally do not buy new unless I've thoroughly researched the fabric the item is made of and how it is produced. For example, I'd consider it more eco conscious to buy leather that I know is raised and tanned in an environmentally conscious way than buy fabrics like eucalyptus rayon, bamboo rayon, and other synthetics.  I do not consider any fabrics vegan, as synthetic fabrics either come from the pulp of plants (animal deaths are happening at the harvesting level, or they are fully synthetic and so they cause death and disruption through waterway poisoning and plastic pollution). It would be 100% better to buy from a shop that is using eco friendly tanning methods on their leather products than to buy from a brand that uses 'vegan' materials that are actually just <3 Greenwashing <3 in order to convince uninformed vegans to purchase their products

&#x200B;

\-small operations: (fewer people employed in the making of the product from start to finish, fewer separate entities involved, so fewer places where the producer could miss ethical or environmental issues). This helps ensure portions of all 3 of your qualifications. in my opinion ONLY a relatively small operation can be truly sustainable in the long term. many people disagree on this but that's okay as it's just my opinion ;) A small operation is also likely to be able to answer questions about their own supply chain and their workers. If I can talk to the person making my garment, all the better, and this is why I usually choose one woman style operations to support. I can direct all questions straight to the source and the overall cost to me is rarely higher than for mass produced items at places like patagonia, prana, simplebasics etcetcetc 

&#x200B;

\-small number of items, items made to order or to your personal size: the less individual items, patterns, styles, colors a brand sells, the more likely it is that they are aware of the impact of each of the colors used, don't have a bunch of overstock (aka wasted materials and wasted resources to create them). Slow fashion means there might be limited pieces, and it may take time for your piece to be made. Ideally we would all be buying less, so waiting for a well made piece created just for me is worth it.

&#x200B;

\-Indicators of greenwashing...there are some exceptions of course, but pretty much any company is greenwashing that has out a special campaign about how ethical and positive they are and yet::::: creates items in many different places, ships items all over the country, tries to take over an entire industry (issues inevitably arise when your production line gets larger and larger), keeps lights on in stores all over, uses lots of synthetic fabrics, isn't 100% able to answer queries about their supply chain IN DETAIL including things like disposal methods for water used in construction and dyeing process and 100 other questions that we as consumers need to learn to ask... It can get really overwhelming doing all this research...so, again, that's where we come to buying from small time shops on places like etsy. If you can speak to the person making your clothing, ask about their processes, where the fabric came from...follow them on instagram and learn the details of their production and creative process...then you are able to get closer to truly sustainable and ethical consumption. On top of that, the human to human exchange creates a sort of sanctity about the consumption process that slows things down and refocuses",6,1607744737.0,None,0

I’ve never returned anything because I really like the quality of the clothes. They use really good material. None of this cheap half way see through stuff. I ordered beige pants and you still can’t see through them. And they actually had real pockets.

Lichi - brand experiences,"I know this thread is already old, but I just wanted to share my experience with Lichi as well, just in case sometime like me at some point wants to know and starts researching...

I was very careful about them too and was googling a loooot to be sure if I could trust the brand or not. Especially their claim ""designed in Frankfurt (Germany)"" but shipping from Poland was little odd to me and made me hesitant. I always read very good and very bad experiences, so I became careful in general about them.

But some weeks ago I found one dress in their shop that instantly catched my eye and I thought maybe trying it out myself is a good way now after reading all kinds of reviews. 

The deal about Lichi (just like for sarahberlin.com, which is an Ukrainian brand) is you really should ask them BEFORE ordering something, if clothing XYZ is still available. I noticed they don't update their store too often, but to me this is somewhat okay since their customer service was in my case always excellent and fast. I texted them via email once, but later mostly via their WhatsApp business chat and they replied very quickly and have always been super helpful or offered a way to help me. 

I ordered the dress in 2 sizes (as discussed with them) and just a few days prior sent the bigger one back. The quality of the dress actually surprised me in a positive way (maybe it's different on some dresses? Idk. On this one is was super good), it was by far better quality than anything I buy in H&M, Zara etc. So absolutely NO complains about this either. The sizes may be a bit tricky and run a little smaller than usual, so I recommend comparing your own measurements to their size table on each clothing part.

I don't know why people say you'd pay a lot of money for returns, because the return only costs 5€ in Germany for example (their warehourse is located in Poland). The return was super easy and quick and the customer service also assisted me here.

I personally can't say any negative thing about Lichi. Also to keep in kind, most people who comment on reviews are usually people who made bad experiences and want to let off steam, so maybe don't listen all too much to those comments. Negative things are always much more likely to be posted and much louder than positive, since people tend to forget about reviewing due to their satisfaction.",2,1730046048.0,floofyfloof-moth,0
